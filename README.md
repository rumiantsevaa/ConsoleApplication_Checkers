This C++ program represents a console-based Checkers game for two players. The game board is an 8x8 grid where players, represented by 'R' (Red) and 'B' (Black), take turns making moves. Here's an overview of the key functionalities:

Board Initialization:

The game board is initialized with alternating empty spaces and pieces for Red and Black players.
Empty cells are denoted by '-'.
Red pieces are represented by 'R'.
Black pieces are represented by 'B'.
Display Board:

The program provides a clear display of the current game board after each move.
Players can easily track the positions of their pieces and the overall game state.
Move Validation:

The game ensures that moves are legal and conform to the rules of checkers.
Validations include checking if the starting position is correct, the ending position is empty, the move is diagonal, and other rules specific to checkers.
Move Execution and Capture:

Valid moves are executed on the board, updating the positions of pieces accordingly.
If a move results in capturing an opponent's piece, the captured piece is removed from the board.
Turn-Based System:

Players take turns making moves.
The program prompts the current player for their move and updates the board accordingly.
Game Over Conditions:

The game checks for victory conditions after each move.
If a player has no legal moves left, the other player wins.
User Interaction:

Players input their moves using the console.
The program provides feedback on the legality of moves and prompts players to try again if an illegal move is detected.
Usage:

Compile and run the program.
Players input moves in the format (x1 y1 x2 y2), where (x1, y1) is the starting position, and (x2, y2) is the destination.
